phpmailer - PHP email class
==============================
http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net

Please read LICENSE for information on this softwares availability and
distribution.

Class Features:
- Can send HTML emails, multiple attachments from the file system 
or from a string or database, use multiple main and
backup SMTP servers, wrap emails for Pine and Kmail client users
- Now with SMTP authentication and multipart/alternative support
- Can send using three different mail methods: via a SMTP class, the
/usr/sbin/sendmail program (and the qmail equivalent), and the PHP
mail() function. This can be changed without changing any existing
code
- Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail and AspMail
Windows COM components
- Class can be extended to include new methods or replace existing
methods
- Ease transition of ASP based sites to PHP
- Expose advanced email functionality without hacking headers
- Works on both Windows and Unix
- Hopes to provide a stable and standard way to access email
functions in PHP


Why you might need it:

Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function
that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose
any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like
HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary
development tools out there that have all the functionality built into
easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these
programs are COM components only available on Windows.  They are also a
little pricey for smaller projects.

Since I do Linux development I’ve missed these tools for my PHP coding.
So I built a version myself that implements the same methods (object
calls) that the Windows-based components do. It is open source and the
LGPL license allows you to place the class in your proprietary PHP
projects.


Installation:

Copy class.phpmailer.php into your php.ini include_path. If you are
using the SMTP mailer then place class.smtp.php in your path as well.

Example

<?php
require("class.phpmailer.php");

$mail = new phpmailer();

$mail->IsSMTP();                                      // set mailer to use SMTP
$mail->From = "from@email.com";
$mail->FromName = "Mailer";
$mail->Host = "smtp1.site.com;smtp2.site.com";        // specify main and backup server
$mail->AddAddress("josh@site.com", "Josh Adams");
$mail->AddAddress("ellen@site.com");                  // name is optional
$mail->AddReplyTo("info@site.com", "Information");
$mail->WordWrap = 50;                                 // set word wrap to 50 characters
$mail->AddAttachment("/var/tmp/file.tar.gz");         // add attachments
$mail->AddAttachment("/tmp/image.jpg", "new.jpg");    // optional name

$mail->IsHTML(true);                                  // set email format to HTML
$mail->Subject = "Here is the subject";
$mail->Body    = "This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>";
$mail->AltBody = "This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients"; 

if(!$mail->Send())
{
   echo "Message could not be sent. <p>";
   echo "Mailer Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo;
   exit;
}

echo "Message has been sent";
?>
